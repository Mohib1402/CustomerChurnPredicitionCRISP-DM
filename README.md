# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and provide actionable insights to help improve customer retention strategies.

## Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found here: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Medium Article

A detailed walkthrough of the project, including methodology and findings, can be found in the following Medium article: [Customer Churn Prediction](https://medium.com/@uu7470911/predicting-customer-churn-a-comprehensive-guide-using-crisp-dm-methodology-14264c42b377).

## CRISP-DM Steps

This analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework and includes the following steps:

1. **Data Understanding**: Gather and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to identify trends, patterns, and insights within the data.
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and data types.
4. **Feature Selection**: Identify and select relevant features that contribute significantly to customer churn prediction.
5. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict customer churn.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning techniques.
